# Cartesi Subgraph

## Running Instructions

The first step is to run a local node, by following the instructions at the [docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start#local-development).
You can either run a node connected to a local ganache private network, or a node connected to a testnet (like ropsten) or mainnet.

The following commands illustrate the scenario to deploy a graph from information available at `goerli` testnet. So you also need to run the node connected to `goerli`.

Some of the steps require a [Infura](https://infura.io) application id to be specified as an environment variable called `PROJECT_ID`.

```
yarn
yarn prepare:goerli
yarn codegen subgraph.goerli.yaml
yarn build subgraph.goerli.yaml
yarn create:localhost
yarn deploy:localhost
```

## Schema

Database schema is defined at `schema.graphql`.

An ER diagram can be generated using the [erd tool](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd), by running the docker image `cartesicorp/erd` with the provided `schema.er` file. The following command generates a PNG file.

```
docker run -i cartesicorp/erd -f png < schema.er > schema.png
```

For additional options run `docker run cartesicorp/erd --help`.

## Testing

The [matchstick framework](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick) can be used to run unit tests of the mapping code with mock data. This is very useful because it avoids the deployment and sync cycle, which can take a lot of time.

Matchstick basically works by running the WASM mapping code with a rust runtime that can inject arbitrary payloads to the mapping handler functions. A set of utility functions is provided by the `matchstick-as` npm library.

This [article](https://limechain.tech/blog/matchstick-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/) contains further information about how it works.
